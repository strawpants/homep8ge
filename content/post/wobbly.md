### a Jellypudding orbits the Sun

Most people think the Earth is a sphere, others assume it's a flattened ellipsoid. And you can even find people who believe the Earth is flat and only 6000 years old. Geodesists go a step further and often joke that the Earth is shaped like a potato. If you would ask me I would happily give you yet another analogy and claim that the Earth is a giant jellypudding wobbling its way around the sun. 

I kind of like that concept, because it helps me to explain my research.
