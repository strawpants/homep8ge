### Do I really need an academic homepage? 
Considering the wealth of academic homepages and blogs around, I'm certaintly not the only one who asked himself that question. I've been wondering whether to make one myself for a quite a while now, and finally decided to give it a shot. You're currently looking at the result. 

The best response I got when discussing this issue with friends and colleagues was probably in the line of "Good on you!: but don't you think a homepage is a tad archaic?". Well [my institutional homepage](http://www.igg.uni-bonn.de/apmg/index.php?id=rietbroek) sure has a pretty archaic look, and frustatingly I can't change that. Interestingly, that's also my prime reason to venture into this: "having the freedom to design and style your own public appearance, and being able to manage your own outreach communication efforts. 

#### While ( Outreach < Publications ){++Publications;}
Unfortunately, in the current academic situation, outreach efforts are still undervalued compared to publishing papers, so keep publishing papers is the way to maintain the status quo. Most of the research grants I've seen put the weight (=resources) on researching and publishing in respectable journals, compared to outreach activities(if any are specified at all). That is not to say that people don't want to researchers to reach out to the general public. Recently, Sander Dekker, dutch secretary of the ministery of education,culture and research, plead that [researchers have the moral duty to communicate their findings to the general public](http://www.scienceguide.nl/201609/de-echte-waarde-van-wetenschap.aspx), but failed to address the question who is going to finance the (significant) workloads associated with these efforts. 

I do have the feeling that there is a mentality shift going on though.
