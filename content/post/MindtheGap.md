Around Christmas time last year, a falling star, caused by the reentry of the GRACE-2 satellite vehicle, marked the end of an unprecedented gravity mission. The data coming from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has yielded many insights and it therefore makes sense to look for alternatives, which can be used to bridge the gap with the GRACE Follow-on mission. A [recent paper by Christina LÃ¼ck et al.](https://www.solid-earth-discuss.net/se-2017-127/) offers a preview of what is possible by using data from the Swarm mission.

#### Fact check: GRACE beats Swarm hands down in terms of the gravity field 
But let's get things straight first. GRACE relied on a microwave ranging instrument to track the distance between the GRACE-1 and GRACE-2 satellite, which came with an extremely sensitive accuracy of about 5 microns/second. To give you an idea, that's about the velocity decrease you experience when you hit a cricket whilst driving in your car on the highway. On the other hand, the [Swarm satellites](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm/Introducing_Swarm) are not equipped with such ranging instruments, but they do track GPS satellites using geodetic grade GPS receivers. This allows so called kinematic orbits (i.e. purely from geometric techniques), to be computed with about cm accuracy. Both the orbits and the satellite velocity changes are affected by the gravitational pull, and can therefore be used to invert for the Earth's gravity field. 
And since the Swarm satellites are still in orbit, trying to compute gravity fields from the orbits, albeit with decreased accuracy, is actually a promising spin-off compared to its primary mission of measuring the Earth's magnetic field.
