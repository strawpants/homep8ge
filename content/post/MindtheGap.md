Around Christmas time last year, a falling star, caused by the reentry of the GRACE-2 satellite vehicle, marked the end of an unprecedented gravity mission. I've been a fond user of the data coming from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and it therefore makes sense to look for alternatives, which can be used to bridge the gap with the GRACE Follow-on mission.

####  Let's get things straight: GRACE beats SWARM hands down in terms of accuracy

####  Ocean mass changes from SWARM data

#### Waiting for GRACE-FO
