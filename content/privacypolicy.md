###  Your data and wobbly.earth
I don't collect any personal data currently when you visit wobbly.earth. This may change in the future when I decide to switch on google analytics again and make the website conform with the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/).

####  A note on the social sharing buttons
The social sharing buttons (e.g. share on twitter, facebook etc.) are implemented in such a way that you only contact the respective service providers when you actually decide to share (i.e. click) the content. A consequence of this is that the buttons do not provide any information on the number of shares/likes, but I think that is a small price to pay for your privacy.
