## Research Focus
I'm working as a post-doc researcher at [the Institute for Geodesy and Geoinformation](http://www.igg.uni-bonn.de) at the university of Bonn in Germany. Besides [teaching activities](#teaching), I use space geodesy to study terrestrial hydrology, oceanographic signals and ice sheet changes. I've (and am) working a lot with the [Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment](http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grace/) to study time variable gravity changes. Furthermore, using radar altimetry over the ocean to study sea level changes is another focus.

In my research, the concept of a [Wobbly Earth](/post/welcome) is a central theme. Many of the signals I'm interested in involve the movement of masses(mostly water) just above or below the surface of the Earth. These masses cause the Earth to wobble as they deform the surface of the Earth, change its center of gravity and shift the rotational axis. 

## Whereabouts
I'm born and raised in the Netherlands in the city of The Hague and am inofficially classified as a  'Hagenees'. One can roughly divide the area of The Hague in a 'high and snobby' part and a 'low and poor' part. The more expensive property can be found on former sand dunes, while the more affordable housing is situated in the lower lying areas (read: mud). People living in the former part are commonly known as 'Hagenaars' while those from the latter part are called 'Hagenezen'.

It was only during the final stages of my study of Aerospace Engineering at Delft university of Technology that I became interested in Earth sciences. To understand this, it may help to think of the mental associative chain: airplanes -> rockets -> satellites -> instruments -> earth observation -> earth sciences. After my study I moved to Potsdam in Germany, and I'm now living in the cosy city of Bonn.
